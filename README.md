## #100daysofcode
Almost a hundred days ago from now (01/10/2020), I decided to do the #100daysofcode challenge. This challenge is simply for someone to code every day and post on social media a picture shows that he wrote a code (every day). And than they share with us the final project.<br>
But me..! I did it differently, every day I built apps, games, web pages or desktop apps. Every day something new and I shared all my apps simulation on my Instagram account (you can see my highlight stories), click <a href='https://instagram.com/medyanis_hiou' target='_blank'>here</a> if you wanna see it. And than I'll mix all my small apps in one big project. So I decided to share all the projects with you.<br><br>
PS: You can check all my project <a href='http://y100daysofcode.ml' target='_blank'>here</a><br>
